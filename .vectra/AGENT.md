# OpenClaw — Agent Briefing

> Read this first. Then `project.json`. Then relevant `workflows/` files.

## TL;DR
OpenClaw is a local agentic runtime running 24/7 on Raspberry Pi. Key advantage: no API quota pain (motivated by frustration with cloud quota limits). Inspired Vectra architecture. Currently production-stable. Potential future path: integrate with Vectra Nexus via Vectra Relay as a local executor.

## How to Start
1. `npm install`
2. Configure API keys in `.env`
3. `npm start` or use systemd service for always-on operation (see `.vectra/workflows/ci-cd.md`)

## Current Sprint
Maintenance mode. No active sprint. Monitor for stability issues.

## Key Constraints
- Designed for always-on Raspberry Pi operation — avoid memory leaks and unbounded state
- API quota is still a concern for underlying LLM calls — prefer local models where possible

## Where Things Live
- `.vectra/project.json` — machine-readable metadata & knowledge graph root
- `.vectra/backlog.md` — internal task backlog (private, not in GH Issues)
- `.vectra/decisions.md` — architecture decision log (ADR-lite, append-only)
- `.vectra/workflows/git.md` — branching and commit conventions
- `.vectra/workflows/gh-issues.md` — GitHub Issues label taxonomy and triage
- `.vectra/workflows/ci-cd.md` — CI/CD pipeline runbook
- `.vectra/context/stack.md` — tech stack details and versions
- `.vectra/context/integrations.md` — external services and env var names
- `.vectra/context/notes.md` — agent gotchas and known quirks (append-only)

## Open Questions
- Integration path with Vectra Nexus via Vectra Relay — design pending
